### Title

* Focused Browser


## 2. Problem Statement

Itâ€™s easy to get overwhelmed by information while working on a project online. Too many open tabs create clutter, leading to distractions and reduced focus. Our software simplifies the browser experience by keeping attention on the task at hand and minimizing unnecessary distractions.

## 3. Proposed Solution

### Description

We are developing a Chrome extension that functions as a to-do list with additional productivity features. Users can add tasks, link them to webpages, block distracting sites, and set timers. These tools work together to enhance focus and streamline the browsing experience, helping users stay on track with their tasks.

### Target Users

Our target users include students, professionals, and individuals struggling with productivity, organization, or focus while working online.

## 4. Expected Outcome
   Our minimum viable product will include a to-do list with task creation and management. Each task can be linked to a specific webpage. Future iterations will explore built-in timers, a site blocker for distractions, and additional features to further declutter the browser.
